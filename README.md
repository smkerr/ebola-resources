## Contributing

The easiest way to add a resource is to [open an issue](https://github.com/WHO-Collaboratory/ebola-resources/issues/new?template=new-resource.yml) using the structured form — no coding needed. A GitHub Action will generate a draft page and open a PR.

You can also open a PR directly. See the [Contributing guide](https://who-collaboratory.github.io/ebola-resources/contributing) for details.

## Local development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-book start
```

The site runs at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Deployment

The site deploys to GitHub Pages automatically on push to `main`. A CI check validates `myst.yml` and builds the site before deploying.
